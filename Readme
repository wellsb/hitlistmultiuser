It works like this

genusers.php - this generates loads of users in a Moodle instance and logs them out to a file called users.out

loader.php - loads users.out into an array, if 10 users worth of usage is needed;
                picks the first 10 users from the array
                loads hitlist.php supplying the username, password

hitlist.php is configured with;
    from config a base_url
    from config a list of urls to hit
    from config it is sent a username to use as an argv
    it creates a sess_username.ses file in ./sessions
    it sequentially hits the links
